# [She's Coding](http://shescoding.org)

This is the code for the [shescoding.org](http://shescoding.org) website.

### About *She's Coding*

*She's Coding* is an open-source website project currently under development in cooperation with the documentary film [CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap](http://www.codedoc.co/). Sheâ€™s Coding is meant to serve as the destination for anyone who wants to learn more about the gender gap problem in computer science and become part of the solution.

**Open-source?**

Yes! *She's Coding* is build by the community, for the community. We currently have a small group of volunteers bootstrapping the project, and we are in the process of defining some simple rules on how to contribute for the wider community.
